# Lenovo-BIOS-Settings-Detection
This script will let you manage BIOS settings for your Lenovo device using PowerShell. Included in the Repository is a script for detecting your current settings and comparing them to the "Good" values listed in the variable $wordbank. There is a second script that will attempt to change the BIOS settings to match the ones listed in the variable. It will automatically pass the BIOS supervisor password through the variable in the event that one is configured. This works well with Proactive remediations in Microsoft Intune.
